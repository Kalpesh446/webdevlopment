1) What are the new tags added in HTML5?
:> (MOVED) article, (MOVED) aside, audio, canvas,command, datalist, details, embed, figcaption, figure,footer, header, hgroup,
    keygen, mark, math, meter, nav, output, progress, rp, rt, ruby, section,source, summary, svg, time, track,video, wbr.

2) How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
:> The HTML5 <audio> and <video> tags make it simple to add media to a website. You need to set src attribute to identify the media 
    source and include a controls attribute so the user can play and pause the media. The current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which
    video formats browsers should support in the video tag. But most commonly used video formats are − Ogg − Ogg files with Thedora video codec 
    and Vorbis audio codec. mpeg4 − MPEG4 files with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec. You can use <source> tag to specify media along with
    media type and many other attributes. 
    he current HTML5 draft specification does not specify which audio formats browsers should support in the audio tag. But most commonly used audio
    formats are ogg, mp3 and wav. You can use <source&ggt; tag to specify media along with media type and many other attributes. 

3) Semantic element in HTML5?
:> A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of non-semantic 
    elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - 
    Clearly defines its content. In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:
   <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <mark>, <nav>, <section>, <summary>, <time>.

4) Canvas and SVG tags
:> SVG is abbreviated as Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector-based graphics and used the XML based format for graphics providing the support for interaction. 
    SVG images are way better than bitmap images.  In SVG images, the vector image is composed of a fixed set of shapes, and while scaling these images, 
    it preserves the shape of the image. Canvas is an HTML element, which is used to draw graphics on the web page. It is referred to as a bitmap with an immediate
    mode graphics application programming interface for drawing on it. The element canvas is used as a container for graphics. In Canvas, we need the script to draw the graphics.
